# Building with Responsive Design


## Responsive-Design-

In this project, weâ€™ll got the chance to build a responsive website. We cloned https://thenextweb.com/ , a tech-focused magazine which uses media queries to gracefully degrade their site as the window size is reduced.

Used:
 * CSS FlexBox
 * HTML5
 * CSS Grid
